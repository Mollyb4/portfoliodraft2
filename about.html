      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Practice
            Practice is held 2 times a week at the Varsity Tennis Center (VTC) from l0 pm-12 am typically on Mondays and Wednesdays. Members are expected to attend practice as often as possible. Practices are run by the officers and typically consist of various drills and games, including singles matches and doubles matches. Practices are generally competitive but become much more serious during national tryouts. 
             
            Trips/Matches
            The trips are one of our favorite things about Club Tennis! We travel all over the country to compete against a wide variety of opponents. From other club teams to division II/III college teams, there is no lack of competition. We take two mandatory trips during Fall Break and Martin Luther King Jr. Weekend. 
             
            Fall Break
            Every year, around mid-October, U of M has a fall study break on a Monday and Tuesday. Club tennis takes advantage of this time to take a trip to a place that is too far away for a normal weekend trip. Previous trips include NYC, Virginia Beach, North Carolina, Nashville, and other southern destinations. The fall break trip is the largest trip of the year and is the greatest bonding opportunity the team has all year. Historically, fall break is when new members become integrated into the team. If you are trying out, please keep your fall break free open, as all members are expected to attend!
             
            Toronto
            During Martin Luther King Jr. weekend in January, we have a tradition of traveling to Toronto, ON and playing varsity teams in the area such as Western University, University of Waterloo, and York University. The entire team will stay in a hotel in the center of downtown. Again, be sure to keep MLK weekend open!
             
            Badger Classic and Regionals
            The Badger Classic is an annual tournament hosted by the University of Wisconsin each October in Madison. The top members from the previous year and any extremely promising new members are invited by the officers to participate. It is a great event to gauge how tough the competition will be for the regional event later in the year, in which the top three teams qualify for nationals.
             
            Nationals and Spring Invitational
            To determine our team for nationals, we hold formal intra-team tryouts in the form of a single elimination tournament for both singles and doubles. The champions of both tournaments on both the Men's and Women's are chosen to represent the University at the National Championships. The runners-up in each of the four tournaments will attend the Spring Invitational tournament the weekend before nationals.
